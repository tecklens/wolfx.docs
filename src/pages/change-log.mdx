  ### Channel And Subscriptions

  `July, 20, 2024`

  We create two entities, namely channel and subscription, to help users manage their direct messages on WOLFX without having to store on your system.

  In addition, we will ensure the **security of data** by **encrypting the data** stored in the database.


  You can start [here](https://dash.wolfx.app/subscription).

  ### Telegram Integration

  `July, 15, 2024`


  We are excited to announce the integration of Telegram into the Wolfx platform!

  Telegram, developed by Telegram Messenger, part of the Maxim Vozdykh's software technology group, is one of the most
  popular applications in the world.
  It's a messaging app that allows users to communicate in real time, often in a short burst of activity.
  It's based on an open-source platform stored on a file system.

  With this integration, you can now leverage Telegram to send timely and personalized notifications directly to your
  users.

  You can start integrating Telegram [here](https://docs.wolfx.app/providers/chat/telegram).
