# Introduction

This is the documentation for [**Wolf**](https://wolfx.app), a fair-code licensed notifications workflow automation tool.

## Where to start?

file-system based routing, built-in syntax highlighting, image optimization,
custom layouts, i18n, and all the features you love about Next.js.
