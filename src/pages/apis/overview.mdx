In this page you can learn about how to work with Wolfx's API

The Wolfx API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs,
accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
<br/>
<CardEndpoint url={'https://flow.wolfx.app/wolf/v1'} method={'POST'} title={'Base URL'}/>

## API keys

Wolfx authenticates your API requests using your account's API keys.
API requests made without authentication or using an incorrect key will return a 401 error.
Requests using a valid key but with insufficient permissions will return a 403 error.

You can view and manage your API keys in the Settings.

## Authentication

<Row>
    <Column>
        You must pass your API key to Wolfx as a Bearer token using the `Authorization` header.

    </Column>
    <Space/>
    <Column>
        <CodeExample code={`Authorization: Bearer xxxxx`} title={'Authentication header'}/>
    </Column>
</Row>

## Errors

Wolfx uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of your API requests.

- `2xx` success status codes confirm that your request worked as expected.
- `4xx` error status codes indicate an error caused by incorrect or missing request information (e.g. providing an incorrect API key).
- `5xx` error status codes indicate a Wolfx server error.
