# Get Started

## Quick Start with Wolfx
Quickly get up and running with Wolfx.

In this guide, you'll integrate Wolfx with your backend web application and send your first notification using Wolfx.

<Steps>
    ### Create a Wolfx account

    First, [**create a Wolfx account**](https://dash.wolfx.app/sign-in) if you don't already have one and log into the [**Wolfx dashboard**](https://dash.wolfx.app).

    ### Create a workflow in Wolfx

    Next we'll design our first workflow in Wolfx via the dashboard.

    A workflow encapsulates a notification in Wolfx. Each workflow takes a trigger call via the Wolfx API, runs the data you provide through a set of logic you configure, and outputs the actual messages that will be sent to your end users. All channel routing and message design takes place within the workflow.

    Here's how to build your first workflow:

    - Create a Workflow

    Click the "+ Add Workflow" button in the top right corner of the dashboard. Name it whatever you like.

    - Add a step

    To send a notification, a workflow requires at least one **provider step**. To add these steps, you can drag and drop them from the right-hand side onto the canvas.

    - Trigger your workflow

    Now, you'll trigger your workflow to notify a set of users.
    When triggering workflows, you need to provide the following required pieces of data in your call to the Wolfx API:
     - target: the user to notify.
     - workflowId: Id of workflow.
     - data: The variable data that will populate your notification templates.

    URL trigger flow: https://flow.wolfx.app/wolf/v1/trigger/
