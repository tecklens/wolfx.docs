# Variables

Wolfx's content creation tools allow developers to utilize a wealth of variables when designing notification workflows.

As developers construct workflows using Wolfx, certain status facetsâ€”results of batch functions and other steps in the workflow - are auto-generated and can be utilized to control the content displayed in notification templates.

These variables offer dynamic and automated properties that hold subscriber information, such as first and last name, email, phone, and avatar.

For example, developers can insert a subscriber's first name into a workflow by using `{{firstName}}`.

In addition to the subscriber's details, developers can use data payload variables that encapsulate dynamic data meant to be injected into the content of a workflow.

For instance, in the code example the variables username and resetLink are data payload variables that would be adjusted based on the workflow's purpose.
