## Account Setup


The deployment of Telegram will be a bit more complicated compared to other chat services.
Here is a brief description/guide to help you deploy Telegram with Wolfx.

First, you need to have an account.
Telegram will use your phone number as authentication to allow you to log in to your account.
Therefore, download and install the app on your phone through [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger) or [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807).

After installing and creating an account, you can use the [web](https://web.telegram.org/) version for easier setup. This is optional.

## Bot setup

When working with Telegram notifications, you must create a bot.
Only after completing this can you obtain the **bot_token**, which is crucial for Wolfx to connect to Telegram.

To do this you will have to open a communication (inside Telegram) to the [BotFather](https://botsfortelegram.com/project/the-bot-father/).
He is available to all users signed up to the platform. Once you've got a dialog box open to him:

- Type: /newbot
- Answer the questions it asks after doing this (which get the name of it, etc).
- When you've completed step 2, you will be provided a bot_token that looks something like this: 7368449090:AAEgluXjMhayx6kLzm7Z9I1q8bq1xxxxxxx.
- Type /start now in the same dialog box to enable and instantiate your brand new bot.

This process only needs to be done once. When you receive the **bot_token**, keep it safe and you won't have to worry about repeating this process again.
Through this bot, Wolfx can send notifications to different users (in multiple chat threads) on Telegram.

## Get ChatId

To obtain the chat ID, you must first add the bot to your chat.

Follow video:

Then you can get the **chat_id** by pasting the following URL into Chrome.

```shell
https://api.telegram.org/bot<bot_token>/getUpdates
```
