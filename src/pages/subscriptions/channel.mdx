## An Overview of channels
We will start with an overview of channels and how to use them.

  This is a high-level feature. If you're just getting started, we recommend returning to using channels once you've
  grasped fully how to use the workflow.

Channels can be created and modified via the [API](https://docs.wolfx.app/apis/channel/create) or [Web](https://dash.wolfx.app/channel). Each channel can have multiple fields on it:
- Channel Name: A human-readable name of the channel
- Channel Description: A human-readable description of the channel
