# Subscriber
---
In Wolfx, we call the entities designed to receive notifications as `Subscribers`.
Each subscriber is unique and identified by a unique subscriberId.

<Callout>
  We recommend using the internal unique id your application uses for a specific user as the `subscriberId`.
</Callout>

Each subscriber has the following data points:
- **User Data**: Data stored in the subscriber object that you can easily access in your workflow. This contains basic info such as first name, last name, avatar, locale,
email and phone. This data is fixed and structured.
- **Custom Data**: Apart from the above fixed structured user data, any unstructured custom data such as user's address, nationality, height,... can also be stored
 in the `target` field using key-value pairs.
